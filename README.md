# Monkey

The monkey programming language from the [Writing an Interpreter in Go] and [Writing a Compiler in Go] books, with some small experimentation thrown in!

## Tweaks

Whilst doing this I've made some tweaks to learn a bit more:

- Natively support full UTF-8 rather than simply ASCII as per the book version
